I think currently modern blog systems are not suitable for programmers or hackers, for these reason I decided to switch to use Octopress, a blogger system can let you deploy your whole blogging system onto Github:

### Markdown

no explain, I love Markdown.

### Syntax highlighting

I know there are a bunch of solutions could have syntax highlighting appear on your Blogger or somewhere else, but the real problem is, how do I declare the code blocks?
For an instance, blogger allows you added your js scripts to enable syntax highlight function, but you need to find out the code block everything from a lots of html tags, that drive me crazy, especially when you have a lot of code pieces in the same article.

and in Octopress, we can just take advantage of using markdown, the editing article become very simple, that you could find out any code block in your articles in a second.

{% codeblock %}
Adding code blocks in Octopress is f*cking easy!
{% endcodeblock %}

### Editing with VIM

This is very important for me!

I trust this is also important for everyone that can use favorite text editor for writing blogs.
